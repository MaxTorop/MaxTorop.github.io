I am a PhD candidate in Prof. [Jennifer Dy's Machine Learning (ML) Lab](https://mllabneu.github.io/) at Northeastern University. I'm broadly interested in interpretable ML, self-supervised learning and out-of-distribution detection. I also collaborate with scientists at [MSKCC](https://www.mskcc.org), developing applications of ML to dermatology. I was a research intern at Apple during the summer of 2024, focusing on data valuation methods for large-language models.

Before coming to Northeastern I did my Masters in CS at WUSTL, where I was a member of Prof. [Ulugbek Kamilov's](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html) [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/). At CIG I collaborated with Prof. [Dmitriy Yablonskiy](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/employees/dmitriy-yablonskiy/) (Radiology), developing deep learning methods for MRI processing. I recieved a B.S. in Data Science from the University of Rochester in 2018.

Outside of research I love to watch anime and read. Some favorites are One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist, Dororo, One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Stormlight Archive, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell and East of Eden.
