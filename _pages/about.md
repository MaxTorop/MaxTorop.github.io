I am a fourth year PhD student in Professor [Jennifer Dy's](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/jdy/) Machine Learning Lab at Northeastern University. I'm broadly interested in exploiting the geometry of piecewise-linear deep networks to solve problems and making neural network behaviour more interpretable to humans. I'm also collaborating with scientists at [MSKCC](https://www.mskcc.org) to develop applications of machine learning for dermatology. 

Before coming to Northeastern I did my Masters in CS at Washington University in St. Louis, where I was a member of Professor [Ulugbek Kamilov's](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html) [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/). At CIG I collaborated with Professor [Dmitriy Yablonskiy](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/employees/dmitriy-yablonskiy/) (Radiology), developing deep learning methods for MRI processing. I recieved a B.S. in Data Science from the University of Rochester in 2018.

Outside of research I love to watch anime and read. My favorites are One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Dororo, Attack on Titan, One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Stormlight Archive series and East of Eden.....
